##How Does My Application Work? 
My application is a newly invented and designed version of the arcade game “Arkanoid” or some people may know it as the “Brick Breaker” game. To move the paddle, you use the directional key, the “left” and “right” arrow to move back and forth. To shoot you use the “CTRL” button. You must destroy all bricks to move on to the next level. Set a score and try and beat your score over and over again, for level 1 it is an easy level for you to start off giving you 5 lives whereas level 2 has 4 lives but has more blocks to destroy. Your score is recorded and saved for every time you come back to play the game to try and beat. If you lose you must go back to the start and try again.


Controls

Shoot - CTRL
To Move the paddle - left <- and right -> directional keys
